        After graduating with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">computer science</span>, I decided to
        pursue my passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and
        learned <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem.

        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}

        developer.

        When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy
